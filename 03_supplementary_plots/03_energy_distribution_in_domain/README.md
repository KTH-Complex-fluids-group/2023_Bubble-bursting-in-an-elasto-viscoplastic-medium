Here, the energy distribution within the domain for different sets of parameters is plotted. \
Note, the magnitude maynot be accurate (due to absence of interpolation and integration operations) and should be used for qualitative visualization of different components of energy distribution in the domain. \
The dark black contour represents the yielded region in the domain.
